	description "A new design for dealing with the Wanderer ramp up in ship production and durability, meant en masse to provide a broad base for delivering ionizing damage at range in order to expose targets to more direct fire from other ships. Running with a lighter crew but greatly expanded cargo space compared to the classic Shield Beetle, it also serves as a platform to acquire plunder in battle or bring weapons and war supplies to the newly conquered worlds while fielding more firepower and durability than the Water Bug."
