	description "This weapon is feared by many, and rightly so. It the shock of the bolt of lightning will completely destabilize the enemy ship, taking away its shields and scrambling all of their weapons. This effect will be more devastating the hoter the enemy ship already is - leaving the target no choice but to run. This truly is the peak of Unfettered engineering, able to deliver insane pushback and neutering forces for a split second before needing to reload. The biggest downside is that firing too many of these at the same time can ironically result in making you run out of power."

	description "The Hai developed this weapon as a defensive tool during the Korath raids, intended to make a small ship able to take a noticeable blow against one many times its own size, albeit making itself vulnerable in the process, too. Nowadays it is mostly used by Hai police ships, and rumors have it that a lightning bug with even a single one of these weapons is able to both jam the target's engine and leave them completely out of power."
	description "	What makes this turret so unique is its difference from 'usual' Hai weaponry, in its non-offensive nature as well as in the fact it shoots a stream of energy, resembling a lightning bolt, with the downside of actually empowering the enemy's shields and cooling them as their ship's energy is transferred into them, and leaving the shooter ionized by the residual energy. Due to it targeting enemy ship's energy, however, an ion cannon is required to keep a target disabled."
