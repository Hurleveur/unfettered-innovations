	description "These turrets exist because there is no such thing as 'overkill' to the Unfettered. The bigger it is, the harder it hits, the better. Unfortunately this means these turrets are highly unstable and thus require more crew to operate. At least they managed to optimize it, making it take less space compared to what it could have taken. However, this lack of extra redundancy and optimization came at the cost of range, flexibility and accuracy."

	description "The Unfettered prefer not to use the weapons of their enemies as that would suggest those are better. Instead, they transformed them into these bombs, meant to be carried by fighters. This is a true demonstration of the Unfettered's creativity when it comes to making things unstable."
	description "In fact, energy needs to be consumed in order to stabilize the bomb, so long as it is on the ship."

	description "This is a very specific kind of engine, that combines everything into one package. You can tell it used to be a standard Hai engine, but the Unfettered did many modifications, allowing it to go in some sort of overtuned mode, to make it possible to bring the Bombs as close to the enemy as quickly as possible."
	description "	Because of how unstable these engines tend to be, given they were not meant to fit together in this way, the Unfettered always have an engineer present to monitor their status and prevent them from exploding."
