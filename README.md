Future Unfettered Hai content, not yet fully balanced and made accessible to all for testing. This is just ships and outfits without many missions to back it up.
All feedback is welcome, and contributions as well, especially in the form of artwork for outfits that don't have it yet, but also new great ideas (never hesitate to put on a PR if you want to work together on something).
It's always more fun to create together, and I don't want the full responsibility of this project on my shoulder either.

## Things to do after forking:
Just open a PR to this repo, and don't hesitate to mention me, here or on discord!
