	description "This weapon is feared by many, and rightly so. It the shock of the bolt of lightning will completely destabilize the enemy ship, taking away its shields and scrambling all of their weapons. This effect will be more devastating the hoter the enemy ship already is - leaving the target no choice but to run. This truly is the peak of Unfettered engineering, able to deliver insane pushback and neutering forces for a split second before needing to reload. The biggest downside is that firing too many of these at the same time can ironically result in making you run out of power."

	description "A relic from the Korath raids, the Thunderstorm Turret is somewhat primitive compared to modern Hai ion weaponry. Although inefficient, short-ranged, and unable to fire in a stable pulse like most hai weaponry, it was enough to give the Hai an edge when they needed something beyond their basic pulse cannons."
