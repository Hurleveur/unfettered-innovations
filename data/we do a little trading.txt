			`	Apparently the only thing required to enter this very select casino is the posession of a Jump Drive. As soon as the gard at the entrance gets wind of your valuable posession, they raise their fist and get out of your way, allowing you to head in.`
			`	Once inside you see most of the clients consist in Unfettered captains that have either acquired Jump Drives. They must have done so by any means, you figure you would do well to be on your guard here. You even spot a few shady figures, that are of much more imposing stature than the usual Hai.`
			`	Despite the relatively important presence of Captains, there is actually only one table where one can play, as the supply of Jump Drive is very limited. The prices are very clearly displayed, ranging from money in very varied quantities to weapons and even ships!`

No questions asked about where it came from, but you don't ask no questions either, capish? Now please, get to it." He leaves the place, probably done with his supply of Jump Drives to bet with.`
