			`	Apparently the only thing required to enter this very select casino is the posession of a Jump Drive. As soon as the guard at the entrance gets wind of your valuable posession, they raise their fist and get out of your way, allowing you to head in.`
			`	Once inside you see most of the clients consist in Unfettered captains lucky enough to have acquired the odd Jump Drive. Your gut tells you they must have done so by any means, meaning that you would do well to be on your guard here. You even spot a few not so Hai-looking fellows, judging by their much more imposing stature.`
			`	Despite the relatively important presence of Captains, there is actually only one table where one can play, as the supply of Jump Drive is very limited. The prizes are very clearly displayed, ranging from money in very varied quantities to weapons and even ships!`

			`	You go around a table with a good view on the betting place. As you do you feel like all eyes are upon you, being new here. You figure they must all know each others. One hooded figure addresses you.`

			`	"Whatever you say, kid." He gives you a deep, dark look, and you can guess red eyes behind the hood. You quickly look another direction, and get back to your business.`

			`	"Ha! You got yourself some spirit. That's good, so long as you know when you're in over your head." They stand on all their might, towering over you. "Like now."`
			`	They approach you, and you can almost feel their might as well as deep, unending anger. "Out. Now." As they say this all of them look at you, ready to make use of their very apparent weapons. You have no choice but to leave.`

Nobody will bother you with things like where it all came from, but you don't ask no questions either, got it? Well, what are you waiting for, get to it!" They continue on their way to leave, probably done with their supply of Jump Drives.`
