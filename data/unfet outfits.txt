	description "These turrets exist because there is no such thing as 'overkill' to the Unfettered. The bigger it is, the harder it hits, the better. Unfortunately this means these turrets are highly unstable and thus require more crew to operate. At least they managed to optimize it, making it take less space compared to what it could have taken. However, this lack of extra redundancy and optimization came at the cost of range, flexibility and accuracy."

	description "This is a very specific kind of engine, that combines everything into one package.

	description "	Because of how unstable these engines tend to be, given they were not meant to fit together in this way, it is often needed to execute repairs, hence why the outfit comes with a warranty that is to be payed per day."

However, this reactor has to consume a consequent amount of energy in order to cool itself, resulting in a quite lower energy generation overall, even though this generator does not include much battery capacity either."
