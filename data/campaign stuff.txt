	description "It shines; you can feel its value. For some reason, the text 'nemo me impune lacessit' is written on them. You wonder what that could mean... surely nothing to worry about. Most outfitters are not real 'connoisseurs' of the value these hold however, and would not give you any more than the price of brute gold for it."

	description "This ship was designed to repel raiding ships, near the end of the Korath war. While it would not be able to defeat one of their ships alone, and would struggle in a prolonged fight, its energy weapons and drone support allow it to hold its own until reinforcements arrive."
	description "	The prototype was stolen after the raids and that this ship design was never produced again, given it would be of little use in the Unfettered conflict. Nowadays the Antlion is renowned for attacking vulnerable targets and disappearing before anyone can react, as if always one move ahead."

	description "This drone was customized with the idea of using either a Repeater, to increase the owner's damage output, or a Bullfrog Anti-Missile, to keep its owner safe. The denser materials used allow for better protection, at the cost of a bit more mass and lower heat dissipation."
	description "	This handy drone was only made possible thanks to scavenging and combining multiple alien technologies."
	description "	Drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."

	description "The Sea Scorpion was designed to serve as a mobile platform to launch Trackers from. After decades of hard work, the Unfettered are finally able to mass produce them. The ever growing fleet of Sea Scorpions enables the Unfettered to employ new tactics against the other Hai which alleviate some of their numerical, technological, and logistical disadvantages."
	description "	This version was built from stronger materials, allowing for a stronger hull at the cost of heat dissipation. The owners also made modifications in order to make this ship more agile and flexible, with increased fuel and engine capacity. It is a terror on the battlefield, using its speed and high damage of the Tripulse Shredders to its advantage."

	description "At the core of this vessel are the ancient remains of a Korath raider that, despite making good use of a cloaking device, harassed the Unfettered one too many times. Although it does suffer from higher mass than a normal shield beetle, it also enjoys a more resilient hull and shield matrix."
	description "The owner of this ship is the servant of Tejolis; they are the incarnation of strategical might on the battlefield."

	description `This more advanced cooling system has been developed by the Unfettered with significant help from Korath scientists, who were highly amused with the Williwaw's simultaneous "primitive" design and similarities to a Korath heat shunt.`
	description `	Although advanced for the Hai, the Korath meant this "simple" hydrogen-circulating cooler to be an easy-to-understand stopgap for immediate production, while they brought the Hai up to speed with "proper" heat shunt theory and design.`
